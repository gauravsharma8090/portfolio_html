                that motivate new hires and seasoned workers 
                alike and communicate any issues with upper management to

                Undoubtedly a good place for career advancement but work life balance is too bad.
                 Have learnt a lot of good things in the past year. 
                The company needs to focus more on employee well being.
            </li>
            <li>The work environment was really nice (Frontier/Day One, the Spheres),
                 and the people were really kind. 
                The work didn't have a clear social impact, but was interesting</li>
                <li>The company is way to frugal and management is not filled with leaders. Only bosses. 
                    Typical tech management where tech skills are promoted over people skills</li>
